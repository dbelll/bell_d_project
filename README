The mpi_kmeans python module has to be compiled on resonance using this script:

	./make_py_kmeans


To verify kmeans algorithms and compare their timings:

	python verify.py


Description of files:

	cpu_kmeans.py -- cpu version of standard kmeans algorithm, used for reference

	cuda_kmeans.py -- cuda version of standard kmeans algorithm

	cuda_kmeans_tri.py -- the cuda version of triangle inequality kmeans algorithm

	verify.py -- used to compare and time all the algorithms:
				scipy  = scipy cluster algorithm, if available
				mpi    = triangle kmeans on CPU
				cuda   = standard means on GPU
				tri    = triangle inequality on GPU
